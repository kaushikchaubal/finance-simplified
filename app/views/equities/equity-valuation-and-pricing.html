Overview of Pricing and Valuation
	Share prices are linked to a number of factors:
	Company's anticipated future earnings and dividends
		Dividend growth models
		Free Cash Flow models
		Earnings multiples (e.g. P/E)
	Company’s current financial position and strength
	Current state of the economy
		Domestic
		International
	Current state of the securities market
		Debt vs. equities
		Confidence

The P/E Ratio
	Most stock quotations disclose a stock’s price earnings (P/E) ratio
	The P/E ratio represents:
		The prevailing stock price per share
	divided by
		The company’s earnings per share
	(**Diagram here**)
	Each industry sector has a typical range of “normal” P/E ratios
	P/E ratio then provides a useful multiplier to determine a share’s price given:
		Announcement of latest earnings figures
		Projections of future earnings

Common Performance Measures

Introducing Valuation Models
	One of the most important topics in corporate finance - wide range of parties are interested in the value of the firm
	You might think that we could easily determine the value of the firm from the balance sheet by examining the book value of the firm’s equity
	However, the book value of a firm’s equity is not a useful indicator of the firm’s intrinsic or economic value, that is, the price which outside investors are willing to pay for the whole of, or a share in, the firm.
	Indeed, if we examine the value of the firm with reference to the book value of the firm’s equity, we will often find that the value the market places on the firm is a multiple of that book value:
	(**Formula here**)

Introducing Valuation Models
	Market value of the firm will often exceed the book value of the firm because the balance sheet cannot capture all of the value in a
	firm, or to use accounting terminology, there is a significant amount of unrecorded goodwill
	Goodwill represents various assets to the firm (such as quality of the firm’s management, the quality of the firm’s products,
	production expertise, mature firm-customer relations, etc.) which are not treated as accounting assets and measured on the
	balance sheet unless a firm has recently changed hands
	(**Formula here**)

Introducing Valuation Models
	So what we need ideally is some way of measuring the true or intrinsic value of the firm to reflect what the market would be
	prepared to pay for that firm
	There are a number of different ways of looking at this problem and thus a number of different valuation models:
	The Earnings-Based Model
	Ultimately investors are interested in the stream of earnings generated by the firm which are available to them
	Many valuation models will merely discount that stream of earnings to their present value and sum them
	Alternative earnings-based technique considers the value of the firm to be in excess of its book value to the extent of its
	abnormal or residual earnings
	The Price-Multiple Model
	Other valuation models will look at the earnings of the firm (or some other measure of performance) and consider the price
	multiple that the market would pay for a right to those earnings (or other performance measure) through time

Introducing Valuation Models
	The Asset-Based Model
	Another alternative is very simply to value the firm in relation to its asset base
	However, those assets could be measured at their break-up, liquidation, or replication value, thereby making such
	valuation more complicated than at first glance
	Modelling Value in the Absence of Earnings
	How do we value a company which may currently have no current earnings at all?
	Examples include internet-based companies

Cost of Capital
	Cost of capital
	Whenever we use discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, we need the determine the firm’s proper discount rate
	The discount rate is called the cost of capital or the firm’s weighted average cost of capital
	Debt, preferred debt and equity = capital components
	Any increase in the firm’s assets has to be financed through an increase in at least one of these capital accounts
	Capital components and their costs include:
		kd = new debt issue rate (yield to maturity on existing debt OR before-tax component cost of debt)
		kd (1-t) = after-tax cost of debt (t = firm’s marginal tax rate)
		kps = cost of preferred stock
		ks = cost of retained earnings (same as required rate of return on common stock)
		ke = cost of external equity (cost of equity obtained through the issuance of new common stock – always greater than ks )

Earnings-based models
	Basic idea underpinning earnings-based models is to project future earnings for a firm and then multiply those earnings by a projected price-earnings multiple
	We can define the price-earnings ratio as follows:-
	(**Formula here**)
	What does the PE ratio actually measure?
	This ratio measures the multiple which investors are prepared to pay in the equity market for each unit (pound) of earnings
	It gives a useful indication of the price that investors are willing to pay for future earnings and thus gives us a useful measure of earnings expectations

Free Cash Flow Valuation Models
	Basis for the technique: we project financial statements, use them to calculate free cash flows and then use these as the
	basis for equity valuation
	Free cash flow (FCF) measures the cash that is produced by a business before we take into account the way in which the
	business is financed
	More precisely:
	Free cash flow = Profit after taxes
	+ Depreciation
	+ Net after-tax interest payments
	- Increase in current assets
	+ Increase in current liabilities
	- Increase in fixed assets at cost
